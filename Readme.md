# EIGen: Evolutionary Illusion Generator

## Acknowledgments

This tool relies on concepts from W. Lotter and al. (https://coxlab.github.io/prednet/), experiments by E. Watanabe (https://github.com/eijwat/Predictive_Coding_Deep_Neural_Networks, https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00345/full) the pyTorch implementation of Ken Stanley's NEAT (https://github.com/uber-research/PyTorch-NEAT), and useful blog posts by David Ha about graphics generation (https://blog.otoro.net/2016/03/25/generating-abstract-patterns-with-tensorflow/)

## Concept

EIGen generates static images that appear to move: motion illusions. It is based on predictive coding:
